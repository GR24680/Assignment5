      <h1>World Map</h1>

      <p>
        A world map is a map of most or all of the surface of the Earth. World
        maps form a distinctive category of maps due to the problem of
        projection. Maps by mecessity distort the presentation of the earth's
        surface. These distortions reach extremes in a world map. The many ways
        of projecting the earth reflect diverse technical and asthetic goals for
        world maps

      <h1>North America</h1>
      <p>
        North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and
        almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a
        northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by
        the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and
        south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and
        the Caribbean Sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers
        (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the earth's land area and about
        4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third largest continent
        by area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after
        Asia, Africa, and Europe.

      <h1>South America</h1>
      <p>
        South America is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere, mostly
        in the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the
        Northern Hemisphere. It is also considered as a subcontinent of the
        Americas, which is the model used in Spanish-speaking nations and most
        of South America.
      </p>
      <p>
        South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq
        mi). Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than
        371,090,000. South America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and
        North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and
        North America). The most populous countries are Brazil, Colombia,
        Argentina, Venezuela, and Peru.

      <h1>Europe</h1>
      <p>
        Europe is the world's second-smallest continent by surface area,
        covering about 10,180,000 square kilometers (3,930,000 sq mi) or 2% of
        the Earth's surface and about 6.8% of its land area. Of Europe's
        approximately 50 countries, Russia is by far the largest by both area
        and population, taking up 40% of the continent (although the country has
        territory in both Europe and Asia), while Vatican City is the smallest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Europe is the third-most populous continent after Asia and Africa, with
        a population of 739–743 million or about 11% of the world's population.

      <h1>Africa</h1>
      <p>
        Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent.
        At about 30.2 million km² (11.7 million sq mi) including adjacent
        islands, it covers six percent of Earth's total surface area and 20.4
        percent of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it
        accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is
        surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal
        and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian
        Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The
        continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It has 54 fully
        recognized sovereign states (or countries), nine territories and two de
        facto independent states with limited or no recognition.

      <h1>Asia</h1>
      <p>
        Asia is the Earth's largest and most populous continent, located
        primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres. Though it covers only
        8.7% of the Earth's total surface area, it comprises 30% of Earth's land
        area, and has historically been home to the bulk of the planet's human
        population (currently roughly 60%). Asia is notable for not only overall
        large size and population, but unusually dense and large settlements as
        well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4
        billion people. Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East
        Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but
        overall population growth has since fallen to world average levels.
